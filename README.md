# Welcome to the Snake Game Challenge!

## Introduction

This is a set of programming tasks that will allow a young developer to understand more about programming.

There are 8 'lessons', ranging in difficulty and length, at the end of which you should have a fully working snake game!

Thank you to the original version of the snake game which I have adapted, from [sanchitgangwar](https://gist.github.com/sanchitgangwar/2158089).

Each lesson will require you to type out code, but don't worry, it's all provided for you!

To help complete the exercises, there is a Trello board with the instructions.

## Setup

### Getting the files

#### Using Git/terminal

```git clone git@github.com:georgedeeks/SnakeGameChallenge```

#### Using Zip

1. Go to <<https://github.com/georgedeeks/SnakeGameChallenge>>

2. Click on 'Clone or download'

3. Select 'Download ZIP'

4. Unzip file using your computer

### Setting up Trello

#### Using a Trello account (complete tasks online)

1. Navigate to <<https://trello.com/b/sHP9tycu>>

2. Sign in to Trello or create a new account

3. Whilst on the 'Snake Game Challenge' board, find the menu on the right hand side (you may have to click 'Show Menu' on the right hand side)

4. On the menu, click 'More'

5. Click 'Copy Board'

6. Give your board a title, e.g. 'Alex's Snake Challenge'

7. You should now have your own copy of the Snake Challenge board!

Now you can click on a checkbox to cross it off a given list. Once you have completed a card, consider creating a 'Finished' list, and then simply drag and drop a completed card onto that list.

#### Without a Trello account (print off manually)

1. Click on a card that you want to print off

2. Click on 'Share and more...' (down the right hand side of the card)

3. Click 'Print...' and you will be taken to your system print screen!

You can then tick off completed tasks on the physical copies of the cards.
