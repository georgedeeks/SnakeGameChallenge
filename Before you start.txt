Download the snake game to a folder of your choice

Open your terminal

Navigate to inside the project folder of the snake game

Ensure that you can run python scripts from your terminal, e.g. type python snake_result.py to see the final, completed version of the game. Typing python anyfile.py in the terminal will run that file, useful to see if you have completed each lesson successfully!

Progress through each lesson in turn, or make a copy of snake_result.py to play around with. There are a series of Extensions which are unguided once you are comfortable with the contents of the lessons, but use your own imagination to adapt the game.

For each lesson, start with the relevant file, e.g. snake_lesson_1.py, which on completion should look like the same code as the start of the next lesson, i.e. snake_lesson_2.py

When filling in code during the lessons, start the typing at exactly the indentation that the # TODO is at

Look at the 'Debugging tips' card if you are stuck with a nasty error!

As you are doing the lessons, try to read all the comments & code in between sections you are editing... it will help you understand what is going on in the code you are just about to change!
