Possibilities

- Adjust the speed setting (including start and max speed and acceleration rate)
- Adjust the snake increase length rate
- Show the player for 3 seconds how the snake has faulted before exiting the game
- High score (for each session) (further extension: record an all-time high score)
- Have 2 snakes (the second could be controlled by the following 4 keys: WASD) playing the game at the same time. If the snakes bump into each other, then it's game over! (Further extension: could you figure out which snake is to 'blame' for each collision?)
- It's game over if the snake tries to move back onto itself... remove this
- Holding down a key will speed game up; remove this
- Adjust the window dimensions. This causes the game not to play properly. Why? Change this. (Further extension: use static initial variables to set the window size.)
- Allow the user to choose starting position and direction of snake

Note: if you edit the code, make sure you edit/remove irrelevant comments, and add helpful ones!
